This repository contains the assignment for GSynergy React Web Challenge â€“ A Two Page React Web App

a. Instructions about how to run and test your code.

Please follow below steps to run the application on your system.
  1. Clone the repository using 'git clone https://github.com/zeeshan-ad/GSIV23_Zeeshan_Ahmed.git'
  2. Using 'yarn' or 'npm i' install all packages
  3. Use 'yarn start' or 'npm run start' to run the application on your browser
     
Note: the application will by default open in port 3000. If for any reason the application does not run in the browser follow the url 
http://localhost:3000 once node is running.

The application is also hosted on firebase hosting from google and can be accessed on the following link: https://gsiv23-4e998.web.app/

b. List elements from the challenge that you think you have done well, and that exemplify your proficiency. Please describe why you chose those elements, and how they demonstrate your proficiency.
In addition to the guidance, I have made use for debounce from lodash to make sure api calls in search input is optimized. I have uset react-icons as they light weight and simple to use and have many options to choose from. And I have used toastify and messages to inform users of any unwanted behaviour. These implementations sheds light on my understand and concept of web app development and react as a framework

c. List what you would do to improve your solution if you had 4 more hours available for this task. Describe why you would do those things.
If I had additional 4 hours I'd created a fallback component if site crashed for any reason with appropriate message. Make the application more aesthetically pleasing. And implement code splitting with lazy and suspense from react as it can be useful when project would scale.

d. Optional: Any feedback about how we may improve this challenge.
I has loads of fun building this small project and to be able to showcase my skills. 

Thank you!
